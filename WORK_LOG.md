It's really dumb though and won't actually work for the problem set so I'll need to rethink it. |
| January 15th | 12:45 - 1:45pm | I started trying to redo the algorithm but realized what I was doing would have an n^n relationship so it would never work fast enough. I need to come up with a better approach now. Update: I started a new algorithm that managed to pass 4 of the 5 cases (again) but failed on test Efficient Large. I think it may be kind of close to a solution but there is still some logic error with it. I'm basically using an arraylist at every index and adding temps to it if they are larger than the max found in that arrayList. Idk if that made any sense, I don't rly understand it myself rn tbh. |
