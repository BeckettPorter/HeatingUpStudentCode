| January 13th | 2:40 - 3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I wrote a quick and dirty algorithm which surprisingly passes 4 of the 5 cases. It's really dumb though and won't actually work for the problem set so I'll need to rethink it. |
| January 15th | 12:45 - 1:45pm | I started trying to redo the algorithm but realized what I was doing would have an n^n relationship so it would never work fast enough. I need to come up with a better approach now. Update: I started a new algorithm that managed to pass 4 of the 5 cases (again) but failed on test Efficient Large. I think it may be kind of close to a solution but there is still some logic error with it. I'm basically using an arraylist at every index and adding temps to it if they are larger than the max found in that arrayList. Idk if that made any sense, I don't rly understand it myself rn tbh. |
| January 16th | 2:30 - 3:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                               I'm trying to figure out why this doesn't work and I'm rly lost. Nothing I change is helping, according to what I went over in class yesterday this should be working but it just doesn't? It's also really slow on the test large efficient so idk if this strategy is even going to work. I think I'll go to class tomorrow and try to implement whatever new strategy we learn because what I'm doing rn is not working. |
| January 22nd | 9:00 - 9:50pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                           I figured out that I was actually finding all the TEMPERATURES that led to a given vertex rather than the vertices that led to it. I changed my code to make it instead get all the vertices that lead to a given vertex and now it works. My issue is that test efficient large is insanely slow, I think it is still running in 2^n time and I need to somehow figure out how to optimize it. |
